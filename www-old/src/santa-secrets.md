In December 2023 YAMLScript is a work in progress.

This is not to say that it's a toy proof of concept.
It has a working compiler, runtime and CLI.
It has unit tests that must pass for every commit pushed to the main branch.
It's well thought out and has a clear direction that I continually vet with a
small group of talented and trusted people.
It has regular [releases](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases).

But that in turn not to say that you should use it in production today.
I encourage you to start playing with it, and I'm committed to backwards
compatibility for stable releases.
But we're not quite there yet.
Caveat usor!

YAMLScript is evolving fast.
While I'm writing these posts, I'm also writing the code for new features and
fixing bugs as I go.
I've had the Advent plan for over a month now, and I had planned to be further
along before December 1st, but such are the time estimates of hackers.

I am attempting to make sure that the code examples in these posts are always
using the implemented features, but sometimes I may fall a few hours behind.
Often I need to write the examples using code patterns that actually work but
are not the ones I preferred to best make a point.

As I fix bugs, implement features and tweak the language, I will update the
posts accordingly.
If you see something that bugs you, try taking another look after a few days.
It probably bugged me too!

Be patient with me.

If I had to guess, I'd say that YAMLScript v0 will be have a stable release
sometime before March 2024.
I'll continue blogging the progress as I go, so it shouldn't be hard for you to
decide when to start using YAMLScript for real.

Overall the whole thing is going extremely well, and I'm having a lot of fun.
It's important to be transparent with you about where things are at.

Stick with me... This is going to be awesome!
